# NFL Data Explorer

The NFL Data Explorer is an engaging and user-friendly tool that allows you to analyze and visualize NFL player data. With a focus on passing, rushing, and receiving categories, this project showcases my ability to utilize popular data visualization frameworks in Python. By leveraging libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Streamlit, I have created an interactive and intuitive app that enables users to explore and gain insights from the data

## Technologies and Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Streamlit
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Altair

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Streamlit application: `streamlit run app.py`
4. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8501` to access the application.

## Features

- Filter NFL player data by year, team, and position.
- Display filtered data as a dataframe.
- Download the filtered dataframe as a CSV file.
- Generate visually appealing and informative visualizations, including box plots, bar charts, and interactive scatter plots.

## Usage

1. Select the desired year, category (passing, rushing, or receiving), team, and position from the sidebar.
2. The application will display a clean and interactive dataframe with the filtered player statistics based on your selected criteria.
3. Adjust the number of results shown using the provided input.
4. Download the filtered dataframe as a CSV file by clicking the "Download CSV File" link.
5. Explore the data through stunning visualizations. Choose from a variety of visualization types, including bar charts, scatter plots, and box plots.
6. The visualizations are interactive and offer insightful insights when hovering over data points.
